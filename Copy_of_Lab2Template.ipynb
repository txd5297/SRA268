The first thing to notice about this graph is that the average win points and lose points are about 10 points off from eachother. This trend keeps throughout the graph creating the positive correlation direction seen. This tells us that even though there are some high or lower scoring seasons, the distance between the winning points and losing points is somewhat constant. The average win points for the lowest scoring year and the highest scoring year are within 15 points of one another and the same can be said for the average lose points."

They are so close that I felt the need to label them so that they may be distinguished from one another at all. Even the top five classes are within 3 points of eachother. This proves that there are not major differences in the Mascot Classes and where there are differences, it is likely due to low number of teams in the categories. The Arachnida in particular only had one team representing that class."

Rather predictibly, each game's lose points follow a pretty close normal curve when compared to the entire data set. I am very surprised to see both 25 and 115 show up in this curve as those numbers seem rediculous for college basketball games. I would say both tail ends of this deviation are caused by particularly good or particularly bad defense and offense combinations."

The same could be said vice versa for the high points on the graph."

It is also interesting to see that the two of the three orders with the best seeds have 45 and 84 teams in them, this is quite impressive to have so many teams that regularly have high seeds."

Another thing this graph shows is how many teams appear to barely contribute, this is likely because many teams don't consitantly make the tournament ever year. As far as the labeled teams go, Pennsylvania is representing pretty well by having three of its universities be labeled on the graph. "
