My goal is to predict when it would be reasonable to put the winter coats away, in preparation for the rain jacket weather. I will say that a winter coat is still necessary until the TMIN is consistently above 35F\n"

This graph does not take into account any single days after April that have a TMIN below 35F because there are not enough of them to warrant still needing a coat."
